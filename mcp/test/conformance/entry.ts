// Test-only entry for `npm run check:conformance`. NEVER DEPLOYED: the deploy target is src/index.ts, and this file is
// reached only by passing it positionally to `wrangler dev`.
//
// The official conformance suite cannot complete an OAuth sign-in through Access, so this mounts the REAL protocol
// layer and the REAL tools (src/mcp-handler.ts) with the door's token check replaced by a fixed read-only caller. There
// is no SITE binding, so a tool call answers "not configured" and never reaches germomics.com. What gets certified is the
// code that ships. The door (src/index.ts) is certified separately, as the config's main.
